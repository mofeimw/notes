The French and Indian War

    - Funny, because French had the same view
    - Britain was losing to the French and their Indian allies
- **Albany Plan of Union** by Benjamin Franklin
    - Called for more centralized government, thus a more coordinated defense
- British eventually won
    - Signed the *Peace of Paris* in 1763
        - French almost completely kicked from North America
        - Louisiana given to Spain
        - British doubled their land (all land East of the Mississippi River)
  
Land hungry colonists push East, which increased Native American tensions  

**Royal Proclamation of 1763** - forbade taking land in the Ohio River Valley

- This frustrated colonists, especially those who fought in the war, because they felt that they had "earned" this land

*However, as a result of the war, British debt* doubled *and the cost of colonies increased by* five times. *This lead to further taxation.*

Nat was a black laborer in Virginia. He organized a slave rebellion, believing that God had given him a mission to do so. He killed over 50 white people, and was eventually publicly hanged with his 55 followers. His rebellion only increased Southerners' fears, which led to harsher disciplines and restrictions on slaves.
