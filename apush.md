Unit 3
------
The French and Indian War
-------------------------
- Part of 7 Years War
- Started because British colonists disliked French encroachment on their territory
    - Ohio River territory specifically
    - Funny, because French had the same view
    - Britain was losing to the French and their Indian allies
- **Albany Plan of Union** by Benjamin Franklin
    - Called for more centralized government, thus a more coordinated defense
- British eventually won
    - Signed the *Peace of Paris* in 1763
        - French almost completely kicked from North America
        - Louisiana given to Spain
        - British doubled their land (all land East of the Mississippi River)
  
Land hungry colonists push East, which increased Native American tensions  

**Royal Proclamation of 1763** - forbade taking land in the Ohio River Valley

- This frustrated colonists, especially those who fought in the war, because they felt that they had "earned" this land

*However, as a result of the war, British debt* doubled *and the cost of colonies increased by* five times. *This lead to further taxation.*

Taxation
--------

- Colonists had to house and feed these troops

**Sugar Act** - taxes on coffee and wine

### Taxation without representation
- Means unjust to be unrepresented in Parliament
- Britain countered by saying they were *virtually represented*
    - Members of Parliament represented all classes and not locations
    - Therefore, the colonists were "represented"

- However, at the same time, they passed the *Declaratory Act*
    - This said Britain had the right to pass any law they wanted to in the colonies

Nat was a black laborer in Virginia. He organized a slave rebellion, believing that God had given him a mission to do so. He killed over 50 white people, and was eventually publicly hanged with his 55 followers.

- *The Liberator* by William Lloyd Garrison
- *Uncle Tom's Cabin* by Harriet Beecher Stowe
- Frederick Douglas
- John Brown
    - Violent and fierce man
    - Raid at Harpers Ferry (1859)
        - Plan was to steal weapons and distribute to start an uprising
        - Repelled by Robert E. Lee
        - Hanged for his crimes
- Underground Railroad
    - A series of trails and safe houses
    - Tens of thousands escaped using it

**Compromise of 1850**  

1. Mexican cession divided into Utah and New Mexico territories and would practice popular sovereignty
2. California would be admitted as a free state
3. Slave trade banned in Washington D.C.
4. Stricter Fugitive Slave Law

**Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**  

- Nebraska was above the 36 30 line
    - Slavery could not exist according to the Compromise of 1820
- Stephen Douglas of Illinois proposed to divide it into two parts, Kansas and Nebraska
    - States to decide by popular sovereignty
        - **Bleeding Kansas** - violence caused by the sides fighting over free v. slavery
    - Would effectively overturn the Compromise of 1820
- Pro-slavery Missourians came across the border to vote for Kansas becoming a slave state as well
- Resulted in two Constitutions
    - Pro-slavery in Lecompton
    - Anti-slavery in Topeka
    - President Franklin Pierce recognized the pro-slavery government

**Political Parties (again)**  
Whig Party was divided into the pro-slavery Cotton Whigs and the anti-slavery Conscience Whigs  
  
Democratic Party was gaining strength as a regional pro-slavery party  
  
The Republican Party was formed in 1854  

- Former Know Nothing Party members
- Abolitionists
- Free Soilers
- Conscience Whigs

They did not advocate the abolition of slavery, simply that slavery should not be able to spread into new territories  

- Southern Democrats didn't care and saw this as a huge threat

**Dredd Scott (1857)**  

Dredd Scott was an enslaved state who lived in Missouri  
He was taken by his master to live in Illinois and Wisconsin, two states in which slavery was illegal  
Dredd Scott sued his master for his freedom, arguing that by living in free territory for two years he was free
  
Chief Justice Roger Taney was a Southern Democrat and decided against Scott  

1. As a slave, Dredd Scott was not a citizen and therefore had no right to sue in federal court
2. The Constitution clearly states that Congress cannot deprive any citizen of property
    - Slave owners could take slaves anywhere they wanted without fear of being deprived of their property
        - This was massive because effectivly any "free" state would now be open to slavery

Lincoln Election/Secession
--------------------------
The Democratic Party was divided into two (three?) factions  
The Northern Democrats were represented by Stephen Douglas (KS-NE Act), and wanted slavery question to be answered by popular sovereignty  
  
The Southern Democrats were represented by John Breckinridge, and wanted slavery in new territories protected by federal slave code, until they became states to decide by popular sovereignty  
  
Lincoln, a Republican who ran on the Free Soil platform, won 40% of the popular vote but won the electoral vote without a single electoral vote from the Southern states  
  
In December of 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union, and within 6 weeks, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana had followed. Later, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina also seceded, becoming the **Confederate States of America**

Civil War
---------
### Advantages of each side
South  

- Fought a defensive war
- Far greater and more experienced military leaders
    - Robert E. Lee
    - Stonewall Jackson

North  

- 4x the population of the South
- Robust navy to control seas and rivers
- Controlled majority of banks, manufacturing, and railroads
- Well-established central government

### Financing
The North rapidly modernized production and manufacturing capacities  

- Future barons of industry like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller got their start by manufacturing for the Union effort

The South relied mainly on taxes and tariffs on exports to raise revenue  

- War tax
    - Confederacy was built on the notion of states' rights, so people just refused

### Public opinion
New York City Draft Riots  

- Law said you could pay $300 to dodge draft if called upon
    - $300 was a lot back then
    - Working class men thought this as an injustice
- Protest against this in NYC turned violent
    - At least 120 people were killed

### Battles & strategy
**Fort Sumter** - a federal possession located in Confederate South Carolina  

- South Carolinians cut off supply lines to the fort from the North
- Rather than fighting, Lincoln announced he would send provision to the trapped troops
- South started firing up Union suppliers

**First Battle of Bull Run**  

- 30,000 Union troops marched to confront Confederate troops at Bull Run Creek in Virginia
    - Civilians came out with picnics to watch
- The Union were destroying the Confederate
- But then Confederate reinforcements arrived with Stonewall Jackson, the tides were turned

Anaconda Plan - The North would use its naval advantage to blockade Southern ports and control the Mississippi River, effectively splitting the South in half  
Union leadership was pretty shitty but they improved (Ulysses S. Grant)  
  
The South strategy relied on foreign help (Britain and France)  

- Both relied heavily on the South's exported cotton for their textile industries
- However, both India and Egypt could produce cotton so this plan failed

**Battle of Vicksburg**  

- Union gained control of the Mississippi under the leadership of General Grant
    - Anaconda Plan successfully cut the South in half
- Destroyed South's infrastructure
- Grant sent General William Tecumseh Sherman to capture Atlanta
    - Sherman burnt it to the ground
    - *March to the Sea* - destroyed railroads, burned crops and land *(scorched earth)* from Atlanta to Savannah

**Appomattox Courthouse**  

- General Grant and General Lee met on April 9th, 1865
- Lee formally surrendered
- The war was over

### Famous Shit Lincoln Did
**Emancipation Proclamation**  

- Lincoln freed enslaved people only in the Confederacy beginning on January 1st, 1863
- Only 5 states in the Union, *border states* (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia) had slaves, and slavery remained

Basically Lincoln freed slaves in the Confederacy were he had no authority to do so, and didn't free them in the border states in which he did  
  
*The Emancipation Proclamation was more of a military strategy than a document of freedom*  

- Enslaved workers in Confederacy escaped plantations and ran to safety of Union lines
    - Some took up arms and fought for the Union cause
- Closed the door on British involvement
    - British had recently abolished slavery
    - Didn't care about Southern cotton anymore

**Gettysburg Address (November 19th, 1863)**  
It was delivered at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery  

Purposes  

1. Unify the nation
2. Portray the struggle against slavery as the fulfillment of America's founding democratic ideals

> "Four score and seven years ago..."

***Lincoln reframed the purpose of the war***

### Reconstruction (1865-1877)
**RIP Lincoln**  

- **John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln on April 14th, 1865 at the Ford Theatre**
- Vice President Andrew Johnson became the President
    - Southerner from Tennessee
    - Did attempt to carry out Lincoln's plan
    - Stood by while former slave owning class recreated the same discrimination

**How the South should be treated**  

- Abraham Lincoln thought the South never left the Union because it was legally impossible would only do so
    - Treating them harshly would only make matters worse
    - **Ten-Percent Plan** established a minimal test of loyalty to return to Union
        1. Could reestablish their state governments if 10% of the 1860 electorate pledged loyalty to the Union
        2. State legislature had to ratify the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery

**Sharecropping** - landowners provided seed and farm supplies to a worker, in exchange for a share of the harvest

In theory it was a decent opportunity for newly emancipated slaves to get a fresh start, but in practice it was just another form of forced servitude  
  
**White Supremacy** - just because former enslaved people were now citizens didn't mean Southerners had to accept them as equal  

- Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1867 on the principle that the white race was superior to the black race, and well, you know their reputation  

**Radical Republicans**  

- A group of Congressmen who hated Johnson's policies
- Wanted Reconstruction to be led by Congress instead of the President
- Pass legislature that upheld and extended rights for blacks in the South and suppressed Southern resurgence
    - Freedmen's Bureau
    - Civil Rights Act of 1866
        - Protected citizenship of black people and gave them equal protection under the law
- Andrew Johnson vetoed both
    - Radical Republicans mustered a 2/3 majority to override the veto, and passed them
- **14th Amendment** - All persons who were born or naturalized in the United States were citizens of the United States, and that every citizen enjoyed equal protection of the laws on the state level
- **Reconstruction Acts of 1876**
    - Passed over Johnson's veto
    - Assured that all laws passed in the South would be enforced
        - Divided the South into 5 military districts and sent federal troops
    - Increased the requirements for Southern states to rejoin the Union
        - Would now have to ratify the 14th Amendment as well
        - Add to their state constitution a provision for universal male voting rights
            - Give both black and white men voting rights
            - Pissed women off though

**(Wo)men**  
15th Amendment - granted voting rights to the newly freed black population of the South  
  
Split the women's right movement into two groups  

- Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association
- Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell argued that it was important to support Reconstruction efforts federally and work on women's suffrage on the state level
    - Formed the American Woman Suffrage Association

The *National* Woman Suffrage Association did *not* like the 15th Amendment  
The *American* Woman Suffrage Association *did*

**Impeachment of Andrew Johnson**  

*Impeachment* - *trial* that determines if a president should be removed from office  
  
Congressional Republicans really wanted Johnson out of office  
  
Tenure of Office Act - made it illegal for the president to fire a member of his Cabinet without Congressional approvement  

- Johnson didn't care and fired someone anyway
- Congress brought a full scale impeachment trial
    - After a 3 month trial, the Senate failed to kick him out by *one* vote
    - However, it basically rendered Johnson powerless

**Some? improvement**  

- Black population established black schools and colleges
- Some black men got elected to representative positions
- *Freedmen's Bureau* helped reunite families separated by slavery and arranged for their education and social welfare

**Black Codes**  

- Placed many restrictions on black people in the south
- Prohibited black Americans from borrowing money to buy or rent land
    - -> sharecropping
- Prohibited black people from testifying against white people in court
    - Violence and injustice against blacks would never be heard from in court
- Racial segregation in society

**Samuel Tilden v. Rutherford B. Hayes (Election of 1876)**  

- Kind of a reason Reconstruction ended
- Tilden won the majority of the popular vote
- Neither won enough electoral votes to win
    - Both the Republicans and Democrats claimed victory in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida
- Special electoral committee, with a majority of Republicans
    - Surprise surprise they declared a Republican victory for Hayes
- **Compromise of 1877**
    - Democrats agreed to concede election to Hayes
    - In exchange, Republicans agreed to remove all federal troops from the South

Unit 6
------
The West
--------
Mechanization - farming using humans & animals -> machines  

- Mechanical reaper
- Combine harvester

1. Farmers could produce a lot more crops
    - Corn & wheat ~2x 1870 -> 1900
2. Small farmers becoming obsolete
    - Couldn't compete with giant industrial farmers
    - Couldn't afford new machines
    - Farms bought out by bigger farms

Supply & demand - prices fell, further putting pressure on small farmers who couldn't survive on the falling prices  
  
Manufactured goods prices soared  
  
Railroad problems  

- Relied on railroads to transport crops and goods
    - Railroad owners charged immensely high prices

**National Grange Movement**  

- Organized in 1868
- Collective aimed at bringing isolated farmers together
- Got political fast, however
- Pushed for laws against railroad corps and their unfair rates
    - Granger Laws
        - Commerace Act of 1886 - required railroad rates to be reasonable and just, and established a federal agency to  enforce this (Interstate Commerce Commision)

Federal government was pushing for settlers to push west (via railroads)  

- Pacific Railroads Act
    - Granted lots of land to railroad companies, who would then build a transcontinental railroad
    - Transcontinental Railroad
        - Opening ceremoy in Utah in 1869
        - 4 more transcontinental railroads were completed in the next few decades
- Homestead Act of 1862
    - Granted potential migrants 160 acres of free land on the condition that they would farm it and settle it
        - 160 acres was not enough to make a living
        - Many would not make it
            - See ^mechanization and small farms not able to compete with big ones

**Gold and silver**  

- Started in 1848 (California Gold Rush) and continued
- Gold discovered in 1869 at Pikes Peak
    - > 100,000 people moving to Kansas and Nebraska regions
    - Boomtowns - Denver City and Boulder City
        - Extremely diverse because whites and blacks are equally greedy

### Society and Culture of Frontiers
Sodbusters - homesteaders that were among the first to cut through the soil  
  
- Only about 1/5 took up the Homestead Act
- Others bought land from railroad companies
- Again, many of these farms failed

By 1890, the US Census declared the frontier was officially settled, after the opening of the Oklahoma territory  
  
- The Oklahoma territory was designated as Indian territory
    - Many East coast Indians were relocated as a result of the Indian Removal Act of the 1830s
        - Didn't think Americans would settle there back then
- Frederick Jackson Turner's *The Significance of the Frontier in American History*, 1893
    - The closing of the frontier was bad because Westward Expansion was always a way of releasing American discontent
    - The frontier was a mythical "fresh start"
    - The West largely leveled class and social hierarchies
        - Afraid that with no frontier, America would devolve into European-like class conflicts

The Indian Problem  

- Reservation System
    - Indian tribes were assigned to strict boundaries
    - Didn't suit many nomadic buffalo following tribes
        - Didn't matter because buffalo population was decimated by Americans
            - Food and sport too
    - Several peoples resisted
        - Sioux Wars
- Indian Appropriation Act of 1871
    - Officially ended federal recognition of the sovereignty of the Indian nations
    - Nullified all previous treaties
    - Lead to another war with the Sioux and others
- Dawes Act of 1887
    - Officially abandoned the reservation system
    - Divided reservation lands into 160 acre plots to be farmed by the Indians
    - Allowed Indians to become American citizens if they settled on the land and assimilated
    - *Assimilationist Movement*
        - Attempt to put an end to distinct Indian cultures through education, locational training, and Christianizing
- Ghost Dance Movement
    - Developed by Wovoka
        - An Paiute Indian prophet in the Northwest
    - Dance and the ghosts of their ancestors would return and drive the whites away
- Wounded Knee
    - South Dakota, 1890
    - US Army was attempting to disarm a group of Lakota Indians
    - An old man rose to perform the Ghost Dance and a gun went off
    - Army killed more than 200 men, women, and children

The New South
-------------
Henry Grady - the editor of a newspaper called the *Atlantic Constitution*  

- Coined the phrase "New South"
- The South needed to be "Northified"

- Southern states surpassed New England states as the top manufacturer of textiles
- Population and railroad construction grew immensely as well

A few isolated cities were transformed, but mostly the South remained agriculturally  
  
Plantation owners still needed labor -> sharecropping  

### Segregation
**Plessy v. Ferguson**  

- Louisiana, 1896
- Law required separate rail cars for blacks and whites
- Homer Plessy was 7/8 white and 1/8 black
    - White passing, but under law he was black
    - He rode in a whites only passenger car, and when asked to leave, he refused
- Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation was Constitutional as long as the separate facilities were equal in kind and quality
- ***Separate but Equal***

**Jim Crow Laws**  

- Segregated... everything
    - Bathrooms
    - Water fountains
    - Public transportation
    - Any public facility that could be segregated
- Facilities were not equal either
- Setback the few improvements that had been made
    - Black people could not serve on juries or run for public office
    - They were accused of crimes and not even given court appearances
        - Lynch mobs and vigilante justice
        - In the 1890s, > 1,000 black people were violently lynched

### Fighting Back
**Ida B. Wells**  

- Editor of a black newspaper based in the South
    - Editorialized against lynching and Jim Crow Laws
    - Received many death threats
    - Her presses were destroyed by mobs
    - Fled to the North and continued

**Henry Turner**  

- Founded the International Migration Society in 1894
    - Facilitated the migration of black Americans to Africa
        - -> Libera
        - Several thousand made the trip, but it wasn't sustainable due to lack of economical help and African diseases

**Booker T. Washington**  

- Black people did not need to fight for equality on a political level
- Instead, black people needed to become self sufficient economically
    - -> power in the voting booth
- He was formally enslaved, and had done this himself
- Deemed impractical

Industrialization of America
----------------------------
Prior to industrialization, Americans made things either to use themselves or to be sold locally, at most regionally  
During this period, Americans began mass-producing goods to be sold all over the world

### Causes
**Railroad**  

- After the Civil War, miles of railroad built increased 5x
- Federal government helped build
    - Gave railroad companies land grants and loan subsidies
    - ~100 million acres total
- 5 transcontinental railroads
    - San Francisco <-> Toledo (Ohio)
    - Nebraska <-> California
    - New Orleans <-> Los Angeles
    - Kansas City <-> Los Angeles
    - Minnesota <-> Washington
- East and West were now easily accessible
    - National market for goods

**Bessemer Process**  

- By Henry Bessemer in 1850s
- Made steel of much stronger quality
- Blasting air through molten iron = better steel
- Enabled manufacturers to produce a far greater quantity *and* quality of steel

**Coal & oil**  

- Greater access to natural resources like coal and oil
- Powered energy for industrialization
- Anthracite coal
    - Found mainly in Western Pennsylvania
- Later, oil surpassed coal as the main fuel
    - Automobiles

**Telegraph**  

- Invented by Samuel Morse in 1844
- In this period, telegraph wires multiplied
- Communications could travel long distances at the speed of electricity
- Transatlantic cable
    - Connected America to Europe
    - Created an international market

**Telephone**  

- Invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876
- Bell Telephone Company
    - By end of 1880, ~50,000 telephones in America

The Gilded Age (~1870-1900)
---------------------------
### Monopolies (not the game)
- Small locally owned businesses became obsolete due to the large corporations
    - Railroad, steel, and oil industries

**John D. Rockefeller**  

- Owner of Standard Oil
- Forced competitors to sell their companies to him
    - Eliminated competition
    - Called *Horizontal Integration*
        - One company buys out all of its competitors until effectively no competition left
- By late 1880s, Standard Oil controlled ~90% of the industry

**Andrew Carnegie**  

- Dominated steel industry
- Vertical integration - a company acquires all the complementary industries that support its business
    - Bought up companies that handled all parts of steel production
        - Mining companies
        - Processing companies
        - Distribution companies
    - Complete domination of industry; little room for competition

These massive corporations wanted to look abroad, and become and empire  
The common people had no desire to do so, because, well, look at America's roots  
  
**Laissez Faire**  

- French for "leave alone"
- Politicians would not intervene or regulate these business practices
    - *Bribes*

Another building block of their companies was **underpaid laborers**  

- Immigrants
- Women
- Children

Huge influx of of immigrants from Europe, most of which settled in industrial centers looking for work  

- Vastly underpaid
- No government regulations on wages
- Couldn't ask for higher wages because if they did, they would be replaced by another immigrant who would work for less
- Factory owners realized they could employ women and children because they did not actually need skill to work; just operate the machines
    - Fuck gender equality; they employed women because they could pay them 1/4 of a man's wages
- Social Darwinism
    - Strong eats the weak

**Gospel of Wealth**  

- Those with extraordinary wealth had a duty from God to invest wealth back into society - Andrew Carnegie
    - Generous acts
    - Philanthropy
- Reduce the societal distance between the rich and the poor
- Hard work resulted in wealth
    - Wasn't interested in just handing out free money
    - Used the money to create *opportunities* for the poor instead
- Andrew Carnegie
    - Gave away ~350 million dollars
        - Libraries
        - Concert halls
        - Universities (Carnegie Mellon University -_-)

These super rich people were referred to as either **Captains of Industry** or **Robber Barons**

### Labor in the Gilded Age
**The Rich**  

- Surpassed the previous generation in terms of wealth
- *Conspicuous Consumption* - Thorstein Veblen
- Basically the rich were filthy rich and weren't afraid to show it

**The Poor**  

- Extremely low wages
- Panic of 1873 & Panic of 1893
    - Working class wages dropped heavily
- Prices on many common items decreased due to mass manufacturing
- Wages rose slightly
- **Even though the gap between the rich and the poor grew, many Americans saw their standards of living rising**

**Labor Unions**  

Work was dangerous, but a single worker had no voice to be heard by these massive, money hungry companies  
Labor Unions were formed as a result of this  

- Political action
- Slowdowns
- Strikes

- **Great Railroad Strike of 1877**
    - Railroad companies cut wages to save money during a recession
    - Unionized railroad workers went on strike to protest
    - Strikes spread to 11 states and shut down more than 60% of the railroads
    - Violence broke out, and President Hayes sent in federal troops - 100 dead
    - Came to negotiations and terms
- **Pullman Strike**
    - Pullman Company manufactured sleeping cars for trains near Chicago
    - Cut wages during Panic of 1893 to save money
    - He fired all the union workers that came to bargain with him
    - The rest of the workers went on strike
    - Union worker Eugene V. Debs directed the members of his union not to work on any trains that had Pullman cars in them
    - Railroad owners were on Pullman's side and hooked up Pullman cars to trains carrying federal mail
        - Protesters couldn't (shouldn't?) mess with the Feds
    - Eugene Debs and other leaders were eventually jailed for hindering rail traffic of federally authorized trains

**Knights of Labor** - a truly national union who allowed anyone (anyone!) to join (1881)  

- Destruction of trusts and monopolies
- Abolition of child labor
    - By the end of the 19th century, children (10-15) made of ~18% of the work force
    - Children would get hurt and die
- Had > 700,000 members at its peak
- Fell apart after the **Haymarket Square Riot** in 1886
    - Members gathered in May in Chicago to celebrate Mayday Labor Movement
    - They protested peacefully for an 8 hour work day
    - A bomb exploded
        - Set off by an anarchist completely unaffiliated with the Knights
    - Ruined their reputation
        - Public sentiment shifted -> violent and radical
        - Membership declined

**American Federation of Labor**  

- Association of craft workers led by Samuel Gompers
- 1 million members by 1891
- Similar goals to Knights of Labor
    - Higher wages
    - Safer working conditions

### Immigration & Migration
Immigration - moving from one country to another  
Migration - moving *within* the same country, from region to region  
  
Both kinds occurred from 1865-1898  

### Immigration
- US population grew 3x in the last part of the 19th century
- Large portion was due to the massive amount of immigrants
    - ~16 million
    - Mostly from Europe (British Isles, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe) *-> East Coast*
        - Left because of growing poverty and overcrowding and religious persecution
    - Largely settled in industrial centers
        - Chicago, Pittsburg, New York
    - Asian immigrants (Chinese) *-> West Coast*
        - Chinese had come since California Gold Rush in 1840s and 1850s

Cities were changing  
Before the civil war, people from different social classes lived together in the cities  
During the Gilded Age, the middle class and the wealthy migrated away from the urban cities, leaving the working class in the industrial areas  

- Tenements
    - Shitty living situations
- Disease
    - Due to close proximity
    - Cholera, Typhus, Tuberculosis 
- Ethnic enclaves
    - Immigrants of the same culture coming together
    - Established their own culture

### Migration
**Exoduster Movement** - a mass migration of Southern black people into the West  

- Blacks left to fend for themselves after Reconstruction
    - No federal protection
    - Ku Klux Klan
    - Jim Crow Laws
- Starting in the late 1870s, ~40,000 black Southerners abandoned the Souther and migrated mostly to Kansas
    - Also Oklahoma and Colorado
- Colored Relief Board
- Kansas Freedmen's Aid Society
- Most successful Exodusters had settled in urban centers of Kansas
    - Got work as domestic servants or trade workers
- Vast majority were still in destitution, however
    - Railroads had taken all the good land

### American Response
Henry Cabot Lodge - Protestant minister who argued that Anglo-Saxon Americans were committing "race suicide" by allowing so many "inferior" races to intermingle with "pure-blooded" Americans  
  
American Protective Association - organization against Catholics  

- Millions of Irish immigrants were Catholic
- Really didn't care about Catholicism, just that Irish Catholics were being voted into office

**Labor Unions** feared that the immigrants would be desperate for work and would work for meager wages  
Union leaders worried these immigrants would undermine their ability to negotiate with manufacturers  
Then the manufacturers could fire all the unionized workers and replace them with underpaid immigrants  
  
**Social Darwinists** believed that immigrants, especially Irish immigrants, believed that they were inferior to "true" Americans  
If they were to intermingle and produce offspring, the gene pool would be forever ruined  
Came to believe the Irish were a different race than the White Americans (???)  
  
**Chinese immigrants on the West Coast**  

- By 1852, ~20,000 Chinese were living in California
- By 1870, ~20,000 -> > 50,000
- Chinese immigrants carried the transcontinental railroad
    - Took up tough jobs no one else would take
- Were equally discriminated (if not more) by the nativists
- Blamed for economic troubles when Panic of 1873 hit
    - Depressed wages for everyone else because they were willing to work for so low
- **Chinese Exclusion Act of 182** - banned any further Chinese immigration to the US
    - *Only law in US history to target a specific nationality to be excluded from immigration*

**Jane Addams**  

- Settlement Houses
    - Hull House
        - Opened in 1889
    - Help immigrants better assimilate to American society
        - To find better economic & social opportunities
    - Taught English
    - Children enrolled in early childhood education programs
    - Taught democratic ideals

### The Middle Class
A large corporation would have three layers - **executives** at the top, **laborers** at the bottom, and a new **managers** layer in between  
They were called *white-collar workers* because they never got their white suits dirty from manual labor  

- Accountants, legal services, healthcare, clerical work
    - Women's roles began to grow in the clerical industry
        - Women learned typing when the typewriter came out
    - Women were being hired to teach schoolchildren as well
- These people made enough to not be confined to the lower class, but not quite enough to chill with the elite upper class either
- This became the new middle class
- Along with this came an increase in leisure time activities
    - Coney Island - the largest amusement park in the US at the time
    - P.T. Barnum's circuses
        - Go watch *The Greatest Showman* :)
        - ^ After AP hell is over

### Reform
Henry George - a politician and economist who thought it was foolish so much wealth could be generated by a nation while at the same time so many of its citizens lived in poverty  

His solution was the **single tax**, which would tax the rich more than the poor  

**Socialism** - All the means of production in a society should be owned and regulated by the community and benefit everyone more or less equally  

Eugene V. Debs joined with a few others and started the **Socialist Party of America** in 1901  

- He ran for president, but didn't do so well
- As a whole, while socialism picked up some pace, it never really completely caught on

The **Social Gospel** believed that Christian principles ought to be applied not merely to one's self, but to cure the ills of society as well  

- Many Protestant preachers crusaded for social justice for the urban poor in the last 20 years of the 19th century
- Especially focused on middle class

**Women's reforms**  
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony founded the National American Women's Suffrage Association in 1890  
  
Also took up the cause of **temperance** - against alcohol  
The Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed in 1874  

- Complete abstinence from alcohol
- ~500,000 members by 1898
- Largely peaceful, along with the Anti-Saloon League
    - Anti-Saloon League sought to eliminate bars, taverns, and saloons

**Carrie Nation** - hatchet wielding crazy woman that hacked apart bars and saloons

### Role of Government
*The Wealth of Nations* by Adam Smith in 1776  

- First implementation of *Laissez Faire*
- Economies are best governed by the laws of supply and demand
- The "invisible hand of the market" will flourish when people make their own decisions

However, Smith had also envisioned *competition*, something which the big businesses of the Gilded Age completely lacked  

- During the Panic of 1893, President Grover Cleveland did pretty much nothing to alleviate the economic disaster
- Even when the government did get involved, they did so half heartedly
    - Supreme Court decided in 1886 that states couldn't regulate railroads
    - Government created the *Interstate Commerce Commission* to ensure that states didn't violate this
        - The ICC was severely underfunded though

However, the government did get involved when gains for business and the economy could be made (but still wouldn't *regulate* businesses)  

- Business leaders worked with Republican politicians to expand markets overseas with diplomacy
    - Laissez Faire capitalists strongly supported the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893
        - Led to the US annexing Hawaii in 1898 - new markets
    - **Open Door Policy** between China and the US in 1899-1900
        - China was carved into *Spheres of Influence* at the time
        - Advocated for equal trading rights in all the ports of China, which were being consumed by European powers

### Politics (again and again)
**Democrats**  

- Mainly Southerners
- Championed states rights and racial segregation
- Counted on votes from big city political machines and growing population of immigrants

**Republicans**  

- Mostly Northerners
- More industrial party
- Counted on votes from black people, middle class businessmen, and Protestants

Neither party had a particularly strong legislative agenda  
  
Patronage - awarding federal jobs to faithful party supporters  
Civil Service - when a candidate won an office, he would sit and listen to thousands of candidates looking for federal jobs because they had been a supporter of him  

- Andrew Jackson was a big proponent of this
    - Spoils system
- Came under serious fire after the assassination of President James Garfield
    - Listened to thousands of men after he won
    - One man he passed on got salty and assassinated him at a train station a few months later

Pendleton Act of 1881 - replaced the Civil Service system with a competitive examination  

- Kind of didn't matter because shift in party philosophy/funding
- Prior, candidates were funded by party faithful
    - They felt they were owed jobs because of this
- Now, they were funded from a handful of wealthy individuals

Gold Standard - federal government would only print the amount of paper currency that could be backed by the amount of the gold in their vaults  

- Currency held its value against inflation
- Farmers and entrepreneurs wanted to expand the paper money supply
    - Unlimited coinage of silver as well
    - More currency would allow them to borrow more money
    - Lower interest rates
    - Could pay debts with inflated money as well

They argued over *tariffs* as well, because back then much of the federal government's budget was funded by tariff revenue  

- In the 1890s, tariffs provided for > half of all federal revenue
- During the Civil War Congress had put protective tariffs
    - Makes domestic products cheaper than importing, thus protecting local industries
        - Helped industrialists, but not farmers
        - Other countries enacted retalitary tariffs, which meant less international sales for them as well
        - Consumers were pissed because their imported products got more expensive
    - Now that the war was over, Congress didn't want to give up their income

**Populist Party**  

- Populist = for the people
- **Omaha Platform**
    - Direct election of senators
    - Use of initiatives and referendums which allowed the people to propose and vote on legislation
    - Unlimited coinage of silver
    - Graduated income tax
    - 8 hour work day
- *No Populist candidate ever won a presidential election*
    - However, they did gain a lot of attention and made the Democrats and Republicans scared
        - Democrats took up the idea of unlimited coinage of silver, which secured them the 1896 popular vote

**Urban Politics**  

Urban political parties were controlled by *political machines* - groups of people who knew how to secure votes for their party  
The faithful would be rewarded with jobs  
  
Tammany Hall  

- New York City
- Boss Tweed
- Organized needs of businesses and immigrants and the poor
    - In turn, the communities they helped were in their debt, and owed them their vote
- Stole millions from taxpayers

Unit 7
------
Imperialism
-----------
Imperialism - the expansion of one country's political, economic, and military influence over another country  

**Alaska**  

- Purchased in 1867
- Both Russia and Britain laid claims
- William Seward, Lincoln/Johnson's Secretary of State, proposed a purchase for $7.2 million dollars
    - Called Seward's Folly because the land seemed worthless
    - They weren't laughing when gold was found in 1898

### Imperialists
Imperialists saw the gold in Alaska and wanted to expand, because there could be gold and other valuable stuff there too  
They also wanted to secure new markets for American made goods, and justified expansion using *Social Darwinism*  

*The Influence of Sea Power on History* by Alfred Thayer Mahan in 1890 - American needed a strong navy to get to the world stage  
Congress approved the construction of a new massive Navy  
Mahan also influenced a scramble to secure Pacific and Caribbean territories to establish American Naval dominance

### Anti-Imperialists
Self determination - a nation should be able to decide for itself who ruled it, and what laws were passed  

Anti-Imperialists argued if America began taking over less powerful nations, they would be robbed of the rights of self determination, and America would really just be a big greedy hypocrite  
America also had a long history of isolationism from foreign affairs - coming from Washington himself  

Also, did the Constitution follow the American flag? Do people of the countries we take over get the same rights?

### The Spanish American War
Some Americans wanted Cuba, which at this point was a Spanish imperial colony  
In 1895, Cuban nationalists attempted a rebellion but were crushed by Spain  

Yellow journalism - competed for readership under Joseph Pulitzer v. William Randlph Hearst by publishing increasingly sensational stories  
They began publishing stories that exaggerated the atrocities Spain committed against Cubans  
People believed America *must* intervene in Cuba to prevent these atrocities  

The US established a naval presence, and in 1898, the U.S.S. Maine exploded in Havana Harbor, killing over 200 Americans  
Yellow journalists claimed Spain was the cause of this explosion, but it was actually accidental  
President William McKinley issued an ultimatum to Spain: back off or we go to war... Spain agreed  

Uh America still went to war and they shortly won

**Effects of the war**  

- Cuba gained independence*
    - Platt Amendment allowed the US to intervene militarily in Cuba if American economic interest were threatened
    - Basically a leash on Cuba
- Annexation of the Philippines from Spain
    - Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt began bombing the Spanish fleet at the Philippines before the war was even over
        - He allied with Filipino nationalists and overthrew Spain
    - Philippines ceded to the US for $20 million dollars
    - Gathered under Emilio Aguinaldo to throw off US rule
    - War lasted 3 years, and the US held on to the Philippines until after WWII

**Annexation of Hawaii**  

- Began in 1898
- New incentive to do so now that the Philippines were under US control
    - Philippines too far away
    - Hawaii was roughly halfway between the US and the Philippines

The Progressive Era
-------------------
### Progressive causes

- Growing power of big business
- Uncertainties in the economy
- Increasingly violent conflicts between labor groups and their employers
- Political machine power
- Jim Crow segregation in the South
- Lack of women's suffrage
- Alcohol

Their members were as diverse as their causes  
However, they all agreed that *society, on some level, was deteriorating and the only cure was significant* government *intervention*  

### Journalists - *Muckrakers*

- Exposed American corruption
- *The Jungle* by Upton Sinclair
    - Exposed the unsanitary conditions of the meat packing condition
- Ida Tarbell
    - Exposed John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company
- Jacob Riis
    - Photojournalist
    - *How the Other Half Lives* exposed the unsanitary living conditions of the poor

### Reforms
Secret Ballot - wanted voting to be done in secret  

- Would challenge the influence of political bosses (Tammany Hall)

Direct election of senators  

- Senators in office were there because of big businesses, not the people
- **17th Amendment** in 1913 - state legislature -> people to elect senators

**18th Amendment (1919) - Prohibition**  

- Largely fought for by women
- Led by Anti-Saloon League & American Temperance Society
- Forbade the manufacturing and sale of alcohol

**19th Amendment (1920) - Women's right to vote**  

Legislative reforms - initiative, referendum, recall  

- Problem: once a politician was elected, they could effectively ignore the people
- Initiative - voters could require legislators to consider a bill that they chose to ignore
- Referendum - voters themselves could vote on the adoption of proposed laws
- Recall - a way to remove a corrupt politician before their term was complete

*Scientific Management* by Frederick Taylor - increasing productivity of factories  

### Desegregation
Niagra Movement  

- Led by W.E.B. Dubois
- Planned protests and other acts for black rights

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  

- Abolish all forms of segregation
- Expand educational opportunities for black children

### The National Stage
The previous reforms were mostly on the regional stage  

**Teddy Roosevelt**  

- President after William McKinley got assassinated
- Ran on the **Square Deal** program
    - Anthracite Coal Strike at the beginning of his presidency
        - Invited both the business leaders and the workers to the White House
        - Took neither side, worked towards a *square deal*
- Trust Buster
    - **Sherman Antitrust Act**
        - Began breaking up monopolistic businesses
        - Did distinguish between "good" and "bad" trusts
- Consumer protection
    - Pure Food and Drug Act
    - Meat Inspection Act
- Conservation
    - Forest Reserve Act
        - Reserved 150 million acres of unspoiled land

World War I
-----------
### Causes and the War
**July of 1914 - the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**  

**Triple Entente** - Britain, Russia, France - **Allied Powers**  
**Triple Alliance** - Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy - **Central Powers**  

The US originally held to its tradition stance of neutrality  
However, several events tempted it

- Sinking of the Lusitania in 1915
    - German submarines would sink any ship that entered the British Isles war zone
    - The Germans sunk the passenger ship
        - 128 American civilians were killed
    - Americans were enraged, but President Woodrow Wilson maintained neutrality
    - However, the Germans kept sinking ships and the US threatened to break diplomatic relationships with Germany
        - Step before declaring war
        - They chilled out
- German unrestricted submarine warfare
    - Germany stopped for a couple years, but didn't learn their lesson
    - Started sinking all ships that entered the war zone again
        - Some were American
    - Again, President Wilson didn't enter the war
- Interception of the Zimmermann Telegram
    - Sent to Mexico asking them to start a war with the US
        - In compensation, Germany would help Mexico regain land lost to the US
    - The US entered the war on April 2nd, 1917

The war only lasts for 20 more months following this, so they really don't do all that much  
American Expeditionary Forces commanded by John Pershing plugged up weaknesses in the French and British lines  

- American troops also took command over a portion of the Western Front

The war officially ended on November 11th, 1918 at the **Treaty of Versailles**  

### Aftermath
**14 Points**  

- Freedom of the seas
- Self determination of nations
- ***League of Nations***
    - Worldwide representative body where countries could negotiate their problems instead of going to war

Unfortunately, Wilson got the Spanish Flu while he was in France and he became ill, missing many of the meetings  
Britain and France got what they wanted, punishing Germany in the Treaty  

- Wilson was not eager to do so because he knew a stable Europe required a robust Germany

The League of Nations was created, but Congress refused to ratify it  

- They feared membership would drag the United States into war without Congressional approvement
- So the League was formed, but without the United States (nice one)

### America During the War
WWI was a *total war* - when a country mobilizes much of its economic, industrial, and social resources in order to win  

Wilson established wartime agencies with *progressive efficiency* (Taylorism)  

- War Industries Board
    - Coordinated labor and management to keep factories going
- Food Administration
    - Ensured that food production was sufficient
        - For both troops and civilians at home

Many people migrated from rural areas to urban industrial centers to find work due to the increased war manufacturing  

**Immigration**  
Immigration from European countries was peak in the years before WWI  

- Emergency Quota Act of 1921
    - Limited immigration to 3% of the population measured by the 1910 census
- National Origins Act of 1942
    - Restricted immigration even further

These Acts reduced immigration, especially from Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia

**Migration too**  
Great Migration - huge portions of the Southern black population migrated to the urban industrial centers of the North (Part 2 of the Exoduster movement)

- Mainly to escape the oppressive atmosphere of Southern society
    - Were treated as 2nd class citizens
- Many settled in Harlem, New York
    - Harlem Renassaince

The South was a terrible place for blacks at the time because of Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, and literacy tests  

Another reason for migrating was for jobs  

- Immigration laws drained the worker pool
- Black migrants from the South came to fill these jobs
    - They still faced discrimination in the North
    - Tulsa Race Riots/Tulsa Massacre
        - Began because a white woman claimed a black shoe shiner assaulted her
        - Whites and blacks fought in mobs
        - Resulted in mass destruction of property in black neighborhoods
        - Left over 10,000 homeless
        - 300 black people killed

**Harlem Renassaince**  

- Revival of the arts and intellectual pursuits of the recently migrated black population
- Jazz
    - Louis Armstrong
    - Duke Ellington
- Writing
    - Langston Hughes
    - Claude McKay
    - Lost Generation
        - F. Scott Fitzgerald
        - Ernest Hemingway

**Public opinion**  

- Espionage Act of 1917/Sedition Act of 1918
    - Made it a crime to oppose the war, interfere with draft, or say anything disloyal
- Schenck v. The United States
    - Charles Schenck and his Socialist Party buddies wrote pamphlets urging young men to resist the draft
    - He was arrested for violating the Espionage Act
    - Court upheld this restriction of civil liberties, saying freedom of speech is *not* absolute
        - When speech constitutes a clear and present danger, then it is constitutional for it to be silenced
- Government also sought to suppress reports of the Spanish Flu
    - Americans dying by the thousand
    - Federal government forbid publications of the death count and nature of the flu
        - Would damage war morale

**The Red Scare**  
Anti-Communism sentiment, beginning in 1919  
Americans were afraid of Communist infiltration after the success of the Russian Revolution  

Palmer Raids - Attorney General Mitchell Palmer tasked J. Edgar Hoover to secretly gather information on suspected radicals, leading to mass arrests (6,000 arrests and 500 deportations)  

The 1920s
---------
### The Assembly Line & Mass Production
**Henry Ford** - made cars (Model T)  

- **Assembly Line**
    - Large conveyor line
    - Each worker would have the same job, repeated
    - It was insanely efficient
    - Completely changed the economy
        - Everything could now be mass produced for cheaper and more efficiency

By the end of the decade, Americans owned ~80% of all automobiles worldwide  

- With cars, people began settling outside urban centers
- Cities were remade, centered around cars the roads

**American standard of living rose***  

### Culture & Lifestyle

Sigmund Freud's studies on human psychology -> ads learned to promote products through subconsciousness

**Popular Culture**  
Radio - almost nonexistent at the beginning of the 1920s, but by the end of the decade many Americans had them  

- By 1923, there were ~600 official radio broadcasts
    - New programs, entertainment

Movies - by the end of the 1920s, almost 3/4 of the American population was attending movies on a weekly basis  

- *The Jazz Singer* - the first movie to have synchronized sound & music
    - End of silent film era

These new medias spread national culture and emphasized regional and cultural differences (especially of race, ethnicity, and region)  

- Very few radio shows or movies depicted the black experience in America
    - This lead to the Harlem Renaissance
- Popular culture often depicted urban life
    - People living in rural areas saw this distinction

**New opportunities for women**  

- Most middle class women expected to have babies and do house work
- Women in urban centers had more opportunities
    - Nursing
    - Teacher
    - Unskilled labor jobs in factories
        - Paid a fraction of a man's wages in the same job
- **Flappers**
    - Symbol of women's liberation
    - Cut hair short
    - Smoked
    - Drank
    - Showed ankles in public *(oh no)*

### Immigration (again and again)
After WWI, there was another influx of immigrations -> another backlash of **nativism**  
Same thing that happened in the waves of 1840s and 1880s  

**Urban v. rural Protestants**  
Urban Protestants -> Modernists - faith was large enough to embrace the changing culture  
Rural Protestants -> Fundamentalists - condemned the degradation of the morals they saw in the cities  

- Believed that every word of the Bible must be taken literally
    - I mean, not *every*
    - *Believed that every word of the Bible must be taken *seriously*
    - Did take 6 Day Creation in Genesis I literally
        - Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925
        - Illegal to teach Darwin's Theory of Evolution in Tennessee
        - John Scopes did so anyways, and was arrested
        - Highly publicized case
        - Scopes was defended by Clarence Darrow
        - Prosecturor was Populist hero and 3x Presidental Reject William Jennings Bryan
        - In the end, Scopes was convicted for breaking the law but overturned on a technicallity
        - General sentiment was that modernism had triumphed over fundamentalism

The Great Depression
--------------------
### Causes
The 1920's were in general an era of American prosperity  
But... the stock market crashed on October 29th, 1929 - **Black Tuesday**  

- Farmers had overproduced for several years
    - Severe debt
    - High tariffs
        - Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930 crippled the ability of the US to sell excess products on a global scale
- Stock was artificially inflated due to risky investment behavior
    - Buying on margin/speculation
    - Assumed that stock market prices would continue to rise -> common practice to borrow money to buy stocks
        - Stock prices rose, and you made back to the money you borrowed (buying on margin)
        - But when the bottom fell out, not only did you lose all your money you were in debt too

### Life During the Depression
- Poverty and homelessness skyrocketed
    - People began foreclosing on mortgages
- Hoovervilles
    - Named after President Hoover (Republican)
        - Criticism of his laissez faire policies at the beginning of The Depression
        - Hoover thought that that given enough time, the economy would correct itself
        - Minimal government intervention

Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 Presidential Election (by a *lot*)  

- Roosevelt was the opposite of Hoover
- He campaigned on heavy government intervention
    - He expanded more to expand the size & scope of the federal government than any president before him
- Transformed the US into a *limited welfare state*
    - Government would take responsibility for the social and economic welfare of its citizens

### New Deal
**Three R's**  

- **R**elief for the unemployed
    - Public Works Administration (PWA)
        - Employed Americans to do federal infrastructure work like building roads, dams, and bridges
    - Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
        - Hired people to run electrical power plants and control flooding & erosion
    - Civilian Conservation Corps (~~J~~CCC)
        - Employed young men between 18-24 to manage soil conservation and forest projects
- **R**ecovery for businesses
    - National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933
        - Main factor of economic hardship was the cutthroat competition
        - Established a set of codes agreed upon by both workers and corporations
        - Minimum wage
        - Shorter working hours
        - Regulation of prices of certain petroleum products
- **R**eform of economic institution
    - Glass-Steagall Act of 1933
        - Increased regulation in banks
        - Limited ways in which banks could invest peoples' money
    - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
        - Guaranteed peoples' bank deposits with federal money
    - Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
        - Regulated the stock market
        - Prevented behavior like buying on margin and insider trading

**The Second Phase**  

- Social Security Act of 1935
    - Provided a safety net of income for workers over the age of 65
    - Part of a worker's wages were withheld by the federal government and then paid back when they reached retirement

The New Deal was criticized by both liberals and conservatives  
Liberals griped because the New Deal did too much for big businesses at the expense of the unemployed and the poor - wasn't liberal enough??  
Conservatives criticized the New Deal because of the extreme federal overreach

The Judicial Reorganization Bill/Court Packing Scheme would allow the president to appoint new Supreme Court Justices for every Justice that was older than 70.5 years old  

- Roosevelt could at the time appoint 6 additional judges
- Aimed to pack the court with judges sympathetic to his New Deal
- Caused by Supreme Court rulings constricting his New Deals' scope
- However, the bill never happened
    - Both parties thought that Roosevelt would near dictatorship status

***The New Deal as a whole transformed the United States into a limited welfare state and seriously expanded the aims of modern American liberalism***  

It left a legacy of reforms and regulatory agencies, while also fostering a long term political re-alignment of black people, working class, and ethnic minorities to the Democratic Party  

Foreign Policy
--------------
American foreign policy was largely *isolationism* after WWI  
President Warren G. Harding ran on the campaign promise of a return to normalcy  

**Fordney-McCumber Act of 1922** raised tariffs dramatically  
**Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930** drove them up even more  

**Kellogg-Briand Pact** - a pact signed among 63 nations (including the US) that tried to make war illegal  

- ??? LMFAOOO
- Negotiated and signed outside the authority of the League of Nations, so impossible to enforce
    - Basically useless

In the 1930s, US isolationism became harder and harder to maintain  
Many Americans were concerned about the rise of Fascist and Totalitarian governments in Europe  

- Benito Mussolini
    - Italian Fascist Party
- Adolf Hitler
    - German Nazi Party
- Michinomiya Hirahito
    - Japanese

Americans didn't like this, but didn't get involved  

- Watched as Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931
- Watched as Germany occupied the Rhineland in 1936
    - Then Austria in 1937
    - Then Czechoslovakia in 1938
- Watched as Italy took over Ethiopia in 1936

Again, Americans did nothing  

***...And then Hitler invaded Poland in September of 1939, and WWII began***  

World War II
------------
Reasoning for not joining the war (Isolationists)  

- > 100,000 Americans lost their lives last time the US got involved in an European war (WWI)
- Nye Committee
    - Presented evidence that certain American corporations had made a shit ton of profit off of America's involvement in WWI

Reasons for joining the war (Interventionists)  

- The idea of isolationism goes all the way back to George Washington
    - Back then, the Atlantic Ocean was a big enough buffer
    - Now, times have changed and this is no longer the case
        - Submarines and airplanes
        - If Britain was defeated, there would be nothing stopping Hitler from bringing the war to America

Franklin D. Roosevelt was deeply sympathetic to Britain's cause, and thought that the US should be involved, but he didn't have the largely isolationist American public  
He began gradually giving aid to the Allies, Great Britain in particular  

- Cash and Carry Program - persuaded Congress to pass a looser Neutrality Act that allowed any belligerent in the war to purchase armaments from the US as long as they paid cash and used their own ships to transport them
    - Britain effectively controlled the seas, so it benefited them the most
    - Britain was running low on cash
        - President Roosevelt x Prime Minister Churchill -> Destroyers for Bases
- Destroyers for Bases Program
    - US exchanged American destroyers for land rights on various British possessions
- Lend-Lease Act
    - Allowed Britain to obtain the arms they needed from the US on credit

At this point, technically America was neutral but they were really supporting Britain and the Allies  

***...Until December 7th, 1941, when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor***

### Joining the War & The Home Front
Over 2,400 Americans had died in the Pearl Harbor attack  
That evening, Roosevelt and Congress declared war on Japan  
Hitler declared war on America, and now America was in the war  

Federal spending increased ~1,000%  
This increased GDP by 15%, **effectively pulling America out of the Great Depression**  

Due to the War Production Board and the Office of War Mobilization, automobile factories began producing planes and tanks, and other factories other war munitions  

Crippling unemployment -> labor shortage because men began shipping off for the war  

- Government made efforts to get women to work in factories
    - Rosie the Riveter poster
    - Women (especially in middle & upper classes) were discouraged from industrial work at the time

~1 million black Americans joined the military as well  

- Double V Campaign
    - NAACP encouraged black Americans to the cause
    - Victory in both the war and racism at home
- There was segregation between black regiments and white regiments
- Tuskegee Airmen
    - Flew in almost 1,600 combat missions
    - Earned distinction

~300,000 Mexican Americans as well  

- However, many were agricultural workers
- 1942 provision that would allow Mexicans farmworkers to enter the US to help with planting and harvesting without going through the normal procedures

Throughout the war, almost 15 million Americans served  

- Selective Training and Service Act of 1940
    - Passed 1 year before the US entered the war
    - First peacetime military draft in US history

Japanese Relocation  

- Began in 1942
- Large population of Japanese *Americans* on the West Coast
    - American citizens
    - Yeah no white people didn't care
- Executive Order 9066
    - Authorized federal government to relocate > 100,000 Japanese Americans to internment camps
    - Even applied to their children, who were born on American soil
    - Removed from homes
    - Confiscated personal property
    - **(Fred) Korematsu v. The United States in 1944**
        - American Civil Liberties Union represented Korematsu
        - Argued that the forced removal was a Constitutional violation of the 5th Amendment
        - 5th Amendment protects Americans from answering for crimes without the indictment of a grand jury
        - Supreme Court ruled the Japanese Relocation was Constitutional because it was a *"Marshall necessity arising from the danger of espionage and sabotage"*
    - In 1988, the federal government formally apologized
        - Offered them or their surviving descendants $20,000 dollars in reparation payments

### The Pacific Theater
US war efforts started out concentrated in the Pacific Theater  

- Wanted revenge against Japan
- Japan was winning during the early months
    - Two battles turned the tide in 1942
        - Battle of the Coral Sea
        - Battle of Midway
    - The US pushed back the Japanese as a result

**Island Hopping Campaign** - bypassed the heavily fortified Japanese islands in favor of smaller, less strategic islands, cutting off the Japanese supply line  
By cutting off supplies, the bigger Japanese islands were disabled as well  

**Atomic Bombs**  
Franklin Roosevelt died in April 1945, and was succeeded by his Vice President, Harry Truman  
He learned that the US already had nuclear bombs courtesy of the **Manhattan Project**  

On August 6th, 1945, the US dropped ***Little Boy*** on Hiroshima  
Three days later, ***Fat Man*** was dropped on Nagasaki  

The effects were devastating, with ~140,000 deaths  

On September 2nd, 1945, Japan officially surrendered *(V-J Day)*

### The European Theater
Russia was the main Allied defender of the European Theater  

- Tehran Conference
    - Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt met in November of 1943
    - Planned the D-Day Invasion
        - Normandy beaches of Northern France
- Germans had conquered and occupied France
    - Puppet government in Nazi control

**D-Day Invasion** began on June 6th, 1944  

- Largest amphibious invasion in the history of the world
- Over 200,000 Allied troops landed
- More than 1 million followed in the following weeks
- After a month, after heavy casualties, Allied forces pushed the Germans back and liberated France
- Then the Allies made their final push towards Berlin

**Battle of the Bulge** - Hitler's last major offensive assault against the Allies  

- Winter of 1944-1945
- Bulge - strategy of driving a wedge between the Allied armies and Belgium
- The strategy failed
- Heavy death toll on both sides

Hitler killed himself on April 30th, 1945  
Germany surrendered on May 7th, 1945 *(V-E Day - Victory in Europe Day)*

**The Holocaust**  

- Germany's terrible atrocities against Jews and other minorities
- Jewish concentration camps
    - Condemned to forced labor or death
- ~6 million Jews had been killed

### Post War Diplomacy
The United States emerged from the war as the most powerful nation on Earth  

1. No battles (besides Pearl Harbor) were fought on American soil
    - Relatively little domestic destruction
2. Role in the victory of the war
    - Only country to have nuclear weapons (for now)

**Yalta Conference**  

- Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt met in February of 1945
- Germany would be jointly occupied by Soviets, Americans, the British, and the French
- Eastern European nations would have the ability to choose their leaders through free elections

However, after the war ended, Stalin claimed these nations for the Soviet Union  
He argued these countries would act as a buffer zone between Russia and Germany  

***The US and Britain wanted to limit communism from spreading***, so they were not happy *(-> Marshall Plan)*  

The **United Nations** were created to be an international peacekeeping assembly  

- Already tried this after WWI with the League of Nations
    - Failed miserably because the US Congress wouldn't even let the US join
    - No ability to enforce anything
- Goal: to prevent future wars
- But the United Nations actually had the infrastructure to keep the peace
    - Whole lot of peacekeeping soldier supplied by member nations
        - Mission to stabilize unstable environments when they arise
